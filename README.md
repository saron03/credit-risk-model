# B5W5: Credit Risk Probability Model for Alternative Data

## Overview

This project implements an end-to-end Credit Scoring and Risk Probability Model for Bati Bankâ€™s new Buy-Now-Pay-Later service. The goal is to predict the probability of default using alternative eCommerce behavioral data (RFM patterns), assign a risk-based credit score, and recommend optimal loan amounts and durations.

---

## Business Need

Bati Bank is partnering with a fast-growing eCommerce platform to provide flexible credit for online shoppers. To enable responsible lending, we must estimate each customerâ€™s credit risk accurately and automatically, using behavioral transaction data when traditional credit histories are unavailable.

---

## Project Objectives

This solution will:
- âœ… Define a **proxy variable** for default using available transaction and fraud data.
- âœ… Select meaningful predictive features.
- âœ… Train a model to output a **risk probability score**.
- âœ… Transform probability estimates into **credit scores**.
- âœ… Predict the **optimal amount and duration** for the loan.
- âœ… Deploy the entire pipeline as an automated service.

## Task 4 - Proxy Target Variable Engineering

Since the dataset lacks a direct label indicating credit risk (i.e., whether a customer will default), we create a proxy target variable to identify high-risk customers.

### Approach:
- **Calculate RFM Metrics:** For each customer, we compute Recency (how recently they transacted), Frequency (how often), and Monetary (total transaction value) using their transaction history.
- **Cluster Customers:** Using scaled RFM features, we apply K-Means clustering (with 3 clusters) to segment customers based on their engagement and transaction behavior.
- **Define High-Risk Group:** By analyzing clusters, we label the group with the lowest engagement and transaction value as "high risk."
- **Create Target Column:** A binary `is_high_risk` column is added, where 1 indicates a high-risk customer and 0 otherwise.
- **Integration:** This proxy target variable is merged back into the processed dataset for use in training credit risk prediction models.

This proxy allows us to train supervised models to estimate credit risk even without explicit default data.
