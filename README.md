# B5W5: Credit Risk Probability Model for Alternative Data

## Overview

This project implements an end-to-end Credit Scoring and Risk Probability Model for Bati Bankâ€™s new Buy-Now-Pay-Later service. The goal is to predict the probability of default using alternative eCommerce behavioral data (RFM patterns), assign a risk-based credit score, and recommend optimal loan amounts and durations.

---

## Business Need

Bati Bank is partnering with a fast-growing eCommerce platform to provide flexible credit for online shoppers. To enable responsible lending, we must estimate each customerâ€™s credit risk accurately and automatically, using behavioral transaction data when traditional credit histories are unavailable.

---

## Project Objectives

This solution will:
- âœ… Define a **proxy variable** for default using available transaction and fraud data.
- âœ… Select meaningful predictive features.
- âœ… Train a model to output a **risk probability score**.
- âœ… Transform probability estimates into **credit scores**.
- âœ… Predict the **optimal amount and duration** for the loan.
- âœ… Deploy the entire pipeline as an automated service.

# Task 6 - Model Deployment and Continuous Integration

This project packages a trained credit risk model into a containerized FastAPI service and sets up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and ensure code quality.

## Features

- **FastAPI REST API** that loads the best model from the MLflow registry.
- `/predict` endpoint accepts customer data and returns risk probabilities.
- Request and response data validated using Pydantic models.
- **Dockerized** service with a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for easy build and deployment.
- **CI/CD pipeline** configured via GitHub Actions to:
  - Run code linting with `flake8`.
  - Execute unit tests using `pytest`.
- Build fails if linting or tests do not pass, ensuring code quality.
