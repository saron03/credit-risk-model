# B5W5: Credit Risk Probability Model for Alternative Data

## Overview

This project implements an end-to-end Credit Scoring and Risk Probability Model for Bati Bankâ€™s new Buy-Now-Pay-Later service. The goal is to predict the probability of default using alternative eCommerce behavioral data (RFM patterns), assign a risk-based credit score, and recommend optimal loan amounts and durations.

---

## Business Need

Bati Bank is partnering with a fast-growing eCommerce platform to provide flexible credit for online shoppers. To enable responsible lending, we must estimate each customerâ€™s credit risk accurately and automatically, using behavioral transaction data when traditional credit histories are unavailable.

---

## Project Objectives

This solution will:
- âœ… Define a **proxy variable** for default using available transaction and fraud data.
- âœ… Select meaningful predictive features.
- âœ… Train a model to output a **risk probability score**.
- âœ… Transform probability estimates into **credit scores**.
- âœ… Predict the **optimal amount and duration** for the loan.
- âœ… Deploy the entire pipeline as an automated service.
